The web is full of small businesses stuck on slow, expensive, overcomplicated platforms. They pay for features they don’t use, and hosting they don’t need.

We started **e8e.dev** to fix that.

## **Our Belief**

Technology should be an asset — not a burden.
Your website should help your business grow, not drain your time, money, or energy.

So we built a better way.

# **The Zero-Maintenance Web System™**

### A modern, static architecture designed for small businesses.

Our signature method delivers websites that are:

* ⚡ **Blazing-fast** — optimized for Core Web Vitals out of the box
* 🛡️ **Secure by design** — no plugins, no database, no patches
* 💸 **Free to host forever** — via GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages
* 🧘 **Effortlessly simple** — no maintenance, ever

We combine Hugo and other Static Site Generators (SSGs) with global Content Delivery Network (CDN) hosting and a streamlined development workflow to deliver world-class performance at a fraction of the cost.

This isn’t traditional web development.
It’s **digital liberation**.

## **What Makes Us Different?**

### **1. We build websites that never need updates.**

Zero maintenance means no surprises, no downtime, and no recurring bills.

### **2. We empower you, not trap you.**

Every client gets a personal walkthrough and simple documentation so they can update content on their own.

### **3. We keep costs permanently low.**

No hosting fees.
No plugin renewals.
No paid themes.
No ongoing “maintenance packages.”

### **4. We specialize — and it shows.**

We don’t build everything for everyone.
We build one thing exceptionally well:
**high-performance static business websites.**

## **Who We Serve**

Small businesses, solopreneurs, consultants, exporters, and service providers across the world who want a website that:

* loads instantly
* ranks better
* costs less
* never breaks
* and is easy to manage

If that sounds like you, you’re in the right place.
