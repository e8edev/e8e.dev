Most small businesses run on platforms that are slow, complex, and expensive. They pay for unused features and spend time maintaining systems instead of serving customers.

Technology should move the business, not add operational drag. Websites must be fast, secure, affordable, and simple to manage. That principle guides everything we build at e8e.dev.

## The Zero‑Maintenance Web System™

A static architecture engineered for small businesses.

Delivering websites that are:

- ⚡ **Blazing-fast** — optimized for Core Web Vitals
- 🛡️ **Secure by design** — no plugins, no database
- 💸 **No‑cost to host** — deployable on GitHub or Cloudflare pages
- 🧘 **Zero maintenance** — nothing to update, consistent uptime

Built on modern static site generators and delivered through global CDNs to achieve reliable speed, scale, and cost efficiency.

## Our Mission

To free millions of small businesses from slow, overcomplicated web platforms and give them websites that are fast, secure, affordable, and maintenance-free.

## Our Vision

A future where the web is clean, fast, secure, and simple — powered by modern static architecture, not weighed down by outdated systems.

## Progress

The future of the web is static. See how we implement it in practice — real launches, measurable outcomes, continuously updated.
