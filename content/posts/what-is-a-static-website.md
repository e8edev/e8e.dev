Most business owners have heard the term *static website*, but many aren’t sure what it actually means. To keep things simple, we use the same analogy from our YouTube video.

A static website is basically a set of **ready-made pages** — like printed sheets.
They don’t change automatically. Nothing is generated on the fly. The server simply hands out the finished page whenever someone visits your website.

### A Simple Example

In the video, we show hand-drawn mockups of a:

* homepage
* about page
* products page
* contact page

These pages stay exactly the same until **you** (or your developer) update them.
They are prepared in advance and delivered instantly.

### What *isn’t* static?

We also show a “news” page.
This type of page changes frequently — which means it cannot be static.
News, feeds, dashboards, and ads are examples of dynamic content.

### Why static websites matter

Static sites are:

* clean
* stable
* predictable
* fast
* inexpensive to run
* simple to maintain

They are often the best choice for small business websites, portfolios, service pages, and informational websites.
