Most business owners assume that slow websites are normal — but they aren't.
In this video, we break down **why most websites load slowly** using simple drawings and real-world examples, without any technical jargon.

This article summarizes the key points from the video.

## Why speed matters

A slow website doesn't just feel bad — it affects your business.

Fast websites mean:

* **more trust**
* **higher conversions**
* **better user experience**
* **lower operating costs**

Speed is not a technical detail. It’s a business advantage.

## The real reason websites are slow

It’s not one problem — it’s a combination.

Most websites load **far more code, scripts, and features** than they actually need.

In the video, we compare this to carrying a **heavy box** when all you really needed was a **bicycle**.

## The 5 main causes of slow websites

### **1. Heavy Themes**

Themes often include sliders, galleries, and animations you never use — but your browser still loads all of it.

### **2. Too Many Plugins**

Every plugin adds more code, more requests, and more chances for slowdowns.

### **3. Unoptimized Images**

Photos uploaded directly from a phone can be 3–5 MB each, quickly slowing the entire page.

### **4. Cheap Shared Hosting**

Your site may be sharing resources with hundreds of other websites, making everything slower.

### **5. Too Much JavaScript**

Chat widgets, trackers, popups, analytics — scripts stack up and block the page from loading quickly.

## The takeaway

Most websites are slow **because they’re overloaded**, not because they’re poorly designed.

When you remove the clutter:

* websites load instantly
* performance increases
* maintenance becomes easier
* the hosting cost drops

Modern static architecture solves many of these issues naturally — and we’ll explore that in upcoming videos.
