       THE PROBLEM WITH TODAY’S WEB

      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem With Today’s Web</h2>

      <p class="section-sub">
        Most websites today run on heavy platforms filled with plugins, databases, themes, and
        background processes. They are slow, fragile, expensive to host, and require constant
        maintenance. Small businesses lose time and money just keeping their sites alive.
      </p>

      <p class="section-sub">
        Technology should move the business forward — not create operational drag.  
        Our system exists to replace this complexity with something lean, modern, and reliable.

       WHY WE BUILT THIS SYSTEM
  ======================== -->
<section class="ch-about-section about-left">
    <div class="ch-container center">

      <h2 class="section-title">Why We Built This System</h2>

      <p class="section-sub">
        After years of working with businesses stuck on bloated platforms, we knew there had to be
        a cleaner, more resilient way to run a website. Modern static architecture provided the
        answer: instant load speeds, a near-zero attack surface, and no moving parts to maintain.
      </p>

      <p class="section-sub">
        The Zero-Maintenance Web System™ takes this idea further — packaging it into a complete,
        business-ready framework that eliminates hosting costs and dramatically improves uptime,
        performance, and long-term stability.

      <h2 class="section-title">How the System Works</h2>

      <p class="section-sub">
        The System is built on four architectural principles that make your website fast, secure,
        and effortless to operate:

        <div class="about-framework-card">
          <h3>1. Static Output</h3>
          <p>No backend, no runtime, no failure points — just clean static files served globally.</p>

        <div class="about-framework-card">
          <h3>2. Global CDN Delivery</h3>
          <p>Your entire site is pushed to edge locations worldwide for instant loading anywhere.</p>

        <div class="about-framework-card">
          <h3>3. Atomic Deployments</h3>
          <p>Every update is versioned, reproducible, and rolled out with zero downtime.</p>

        <div class="about-framework-card">
          <h3>4. Zero Dependencies</h3>
          <p>No plugins, databases, or background processes — nothing to update or repair.</p>
